      <h3>Bumpy</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Bumpy</strong> is an inexpensive Open Source <em>blackmagic probe</em> compatible SWD debugger designed to
          be used with ARM GDB. It supports <a href = "https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki">many platforms</a>, but was primarily designed
          for use with our Nordic Semiconductor nRF BLE boards.
          </p>
        
          <p>
          When we built our <a href="http://electronut.in/bluey/"> Bluey</a> nRF52 BLE dev board, we were looking for an inexpensive
          option for our users to upload code to bluey and debug it using ARM GDB. We then came
          across the <a href = "https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic">blackmagic probe</a> (BMP) project - an Open Source debugging tool for
          embedded microprocessors. It greatly simplifies the debugging and code
          uploading process using just ARM GDB - no need to run a GDB server or use an
          additional complex tool like <em>OpenOCD</em>. Although the BMP hardware is excellent,
          it's a bit beyond the budget of our target audience as an add-on programmer.
          So we decided to make use of their liberal open source license and build something
          that fits our budget, albeit with less capabilities.
          </p>
        
          <p>
          Bumpy takes advantage of the ST-Link support of the BMP, and its design
          is based on both BMP and Chinese St-Link V2 clones available for cheap in the market.
          </p>
