      <h3>Bluey</h3>
      <p>
          <strong>Bluey</strong> is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) development board with Temperature,
          Humidity, Ambient Light and Accelerometer sensors. Bluey uses the Nordic
          nRF52832 BLE SoC (System on a Chip) which has an ARM Cortex-M4F CPU and a
          2.4 GHz radio that supports BLE and other proprietary wireless protocols.
          It also supports NFC, and in fact the board comes with a built-in NFC PCB antenna.

            Nordic Semiconductor today announces that Indian electronics hardware developer,
            Electronut Labs, has selected Nordic’s award-winning nRF52832 Bluetooth® low energy
            System-on-Chip (SoC) for its ‘Bluey’ development board. The open-source
            development board is targeted at the hobbyists and makers with limited RF experience.

            Development boards are assistant tools that help engineers and enthusiasts
            to become familiarized with hardware development. They simplify the process
            of controlling and programming hardware, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors.
            Electronut Labs, an embedded systems consulting company, had produced its new
            BLE development board “Bluey” with a set of useful sensors and NFC support.
