<p>Freescale makes some nifty accelerometer chips, like the popular MMA8452, for which Sparkfun, USA sells a breakout board. But unfortunately (for hobbyists) they all come in hard-to-solder tiny little packages, like the 16 pin QFN which is just 3 mm x 3mm across. </p>
<p>After a few unsuccessful attempts to solder the MMA8452 chip at home, I found a better candidate - the MMA7660 which has a DFN-10 package. As you can see from the schematic below, the latter has only 10 pins, and the pins extend to the sides, which makes it easier to solder.</p>
<p><img style="padding: 20px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2013/05/chips.png"/><br />
[From Freescale MMA8452/MMA7660 datasheets, for illustrative purpose.]</p>
<p>I was able to successfully solder the MMA7660 on to <a href=" http://www.proto-advantage.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=3100077">DFN-10 prototype board</a> using a hot air rework station. </p>
<p>I basically followed the technique shown in the video below:</p>
<p><!-- start list--></p>
<ol>
<li>
Apply flux and tin the pads.
</li>
<li>
Place chip on tinned pads - align correctly, apply flux.
</li>
<li>
Heat the chip with the hot air gun.
</li>
<li>
Solder exposed pins on the sides.
</li>
<li>
Reheat the chip with hot air gun to reflow the solder.
</li>
<li>
At each stage, inspect pads with magnifier for shorts, and use flux generously.
</li>
</ol>
<p><!-- end list--></p>

<p>So why torture yourself soldering these microscopic chips when you can buy breakout boards?</p>
<p>A few reasons to consider, especially if you are trying to make a product that you might sell:</p>
<p><!-- start list--></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cost</strong>: The breakout board is usually 4-5 times more expensive than buying the chip.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Size</strong>: If you are designing a PCB yourself, it's going to be much more compact if you just use the chip and not the whole breakout board.
</li>
<li>
<strong>Bragging Rights</strong>: When you walk into a bar and announce that you hand soldered a DFN-10 chip, that will surely make you popular. Right? Right? ;-)
</li>
</ul>
<p><!-- end list--></p>
