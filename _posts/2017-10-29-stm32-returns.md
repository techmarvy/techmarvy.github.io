## Introduction

Last year, I had [written about][1] my experience of getting started with STM32 microcontrollers. There was (and still is) a bewildering number of choices when it comes to ARM programming. After some research, 
I had settled on using ARM GCC, Eclipse, and Standard Peripheral Library to program an STM32F103RB chip. Recently, since I am working again with STM32 for a product, I decided to revisit development options for this chip family.

What I finally settled on is the following:

- System Workbench (SW4STM32)
- STM32Cube
- FreeRTOS
- C++

A few thoughts on the above choices:

**System Workbench (SW4STM32)** 

You can program SMT32 on a variety of toolchains and IDEs. I wanted to use ARM GCC based solution (not interested in spending $$$ on Keil, IAR, etc.) which was easy to set up and get going. [System Workbench][4], which is built on top of Eclipse is a great choice, especially as it is [supported by STMicroelectronics][5]. (Note that you need to register and login before you see a download link on the SW4STM32 website.)

**STM32Cube**

[STM32Cube][8] is an initiative by STMicroelectronics consisting of a software platform - HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer), LL (Low-layer API), and middleware components - plus STM32CubeMX, a graphical tool for generating initialization code for your project - clock configuration, GPIOs, etc. 32 bit ARM chips are beasts compared to their petite 8 bit ancestors, and everything is complicated - whether 
you are setting up the clock or configuring a peripheral. Yes, ultimately it's a matter of 
setting the right values in the right registers and you can code it up by hand, but the amount 
of time you will save with STM32Cube is quite significant. Also having a graphical tool like STM32CubeMX has many advantages. When you have a complex project, it's very convenient to have a visual tool that helps you allocate resources of your chip without conflicts. As you will see below, it can also generate an SW4STM32 project for you directly.

The other compelling factor for moving away from the Standard Peripheral Library is that STMicro themselves seems to have ditched it. There are other options like [libopencm3][9], but I feel it's better to stick to something supported by the chip manufacturer, especially when you are working on a product.

**FreeRTOS**

The boilerplate for any microcontroller project consists of a while loop and a bunch of interrupt 
routines - assuming that you aren't coding "Arduino-style" by peppering your code with *delay()* 
calls. As your projects increase in complexity and you start torturing the chip, you will soon 
find yourself prioritising interrupts, managing communication between routines, and synchronising 
data access. Unknowingly, you are writing your own RTOS (Real Time Operating System). So why not just 
use one designed for the purpose? [FreeRTOS][10] seems to fit the bill, and does not have restrictions 
for commercial use. As you will see below, STM32CubeMX can generate a FreeRTOS project for you. You 
don't have to download on install anything separately.

**C++**

The most common coding language for microcontrollers is C, and that's what I stick to, most of the time. But having worked on complex software projects for many years, sometimes I miss a higher level of abstaction in the code. Although the first instinct might be to reject C++ as too heavy for microcontrollers, some research will show that [C++ use is quite feasible][7] - especially for 32 bit ARM chips with significant Flash/RAM. Personally, the ability to use classes is reason enought for me to use C++ - the code is way more organized than a C project.

I understand that the above choices won't always fit the bill, especially if you are trying to heavily 
optimise Flash/RAM usage on the chip. Now, on to the project.

## Objective

In this project, we will use an STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F103RB board (with the STM32F103RB chip) to run Conway's [Game Of Life][12] simulation on an 8x8 LED grid that uses the MAX7219 driver. The project 
will use the framework discussed above.

## Hardware Hookup

For the 8x8 LED grid, I used an assembled kit from ebay with the MAX7219 driver chip. 

![Max7219 board](/images/2017/10/max7219-board.png)

Here's what the pinout of the Nucleo F103RB board looks like, from the datasheet.

![Nucleo F103RB](/images/2017/10/nucleo-f103rb-pins.png)

The connections are as follows:

|**Nucleo**|**Max7219**|
|-|-|
|PB13|CLK|
|PB14|CS|
|PB15|DIN|
|GND|GND|

The Max7219 board is powered separately using a 5V power supply. 

Now let's get started with the software part.

## Software Setup

Fire up SMT32CubeMX, start a new project, and select the NUCLEO-F103RB board. The *pinout* tab 
look like this:

![STM32CubeMX pinout](/images/2017/10/STM32CubeMX-pinout.png)

Above, you can see that we have done the following:

- Enabled FreeRTOS
- Enabled SYS/TIM1 (For the RTOS)
- Enabled SPI2 and assigned pins PB13, PB14 and PB15
- Enabled USART2 and assigned PA2 (USART2_TX)

The *clock configuration* tab will let you set the (complex) clock system in a visual manner. (In this 
case we just choose the default.)

Now, go to *Project->Settings*:

![STM32CubeMX settings](/images/2017/10/STM32CubeMX-settings.png)

You can see above that we have chosen SW4STM32 as the toolchain and set up the project directory. Now 
go to *Project->Generate Code*. When you do this the first time, it will download some resources (like FreeRTOS files) and at the end, it will give you an option to open this project directly inside System Workbench. 

Once the project loads in System Workbench, the first thing you need to do is right-click on 
the project and choose the "Convert to C++" option. Once that is done, rename the *main.c* file as *main.cpp*.

To upload the code to the Nucleo board, go to *Run->Debug Configurations" and you will see an 
*Ac6 STM32 Debugging* option. You just need to add your project to this section and you are all 
set for uploading code and debugging it under System Workbench.

The above procedure was for creating a project from scratch. But now let's look at the code details 
for this project.

## The Code

If you download the code for this project, you will see the following structure:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/5c9fc4548d4a708b4bdbc40c626c43f6.js"></script>

So STM32CubeMX has downloaded and set up all the initial setup code, required HAL files, as 
well as FreeRTOS files. 

Now let's look at the *main()* function in *main.cpp*:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/cfda272f7f35684ed38057d23ab9b095.js"></script>

In the code above, after HAL and clock configuration, we initialise the GPIOs, SPI2 and 
the USART2 peripherals. Next, the default FreeRTOS task *StartDefaultTask* is created. Then we test 
out the UART using *HAL_UART_Transmit()*. (You can see the output by connecting your Nucelo board via 
USB to your computer and setting up a serial terminal software.) Then we call *osKernelStart()* and 
FreeRTOS takes over. From that point, tasks or threads take care of the program execution.

Also, notice above that we are using functions like *osKernelStart* rather than *vTaskStartScheduler* 
for FreeRTOS. This is because we are using the [CMSIS abstraction for an RTOS][2], and these functions are defined in *cmsis_os.h/cmsis_os.c*. This is a good thing, because if you switch to a different RTOS, 
you won't need to change all your calling code.

Here's the task/thread function for the default task:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/d68f2313cebd89130c0ac2e1d3ee9f46.js"></script>

In the thread, we're toggling the LED on the board and signaling the *conway* object, with a small 
delay in between. 

To implement Conway's *Game Of Life* on the 8x8 LED grid, we will make use of three classes - 
*Conway64*, *MAX7219* and *BitBuf88*. 

The *BitBuf88* is a simple struct (header only) that abstracts an 8x8 1-bit buffer for LED display. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/189f4ac4937b9723b9361ab7fe13c01a.js"></script>

Since each LED is either ON or OFF, we need only 64 bits or 8 x *uint8_t* data to represent the grid 
in an efficient way.

The *MAX7219* is the driver class for the chip, which is an LED driver. The chip uses a simple serial protocol to control the LEDs. 

![max7219-data](/images/2017/10/max7219-data.png)

(Above image is from the MAX7219 datasheet.)

The above protocol can be easily implemented using the SPI peripheral of the STM32F103RB.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/f4e158d7de38b1f58c90b165ec5e3c71.js"></script>

Above, you can see in *sendPacket()* how SPI is used to send a two-byte packet consisting of *register* and *data*. The *setBuffer()* method uses this to send data for the whole LED 8x8 grid.

Now that we know how to turn LEDs ON/OFF in the grid, let's see how to implement Conway's 
*Game Of Life* on it. Here's the *Conway64* class header.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/e80b6666676f37e000be06ed2ba2a2ff.js"></script>

The *Conway64* class holds a grid, a thread handle and a reference to the MAX7219 driver. Here's how 
a *Conway64* object is initialised:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/481480942a39576438275c95bd9ef78f.js"></script>

Above, we set up the correct registers on the MAX7219 driver (or the LEDs won't light up), and 
start the conway task. Here's the task function:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/444e3ff2f39a9516a3775012d66db377.js"></script>

Above we add a [glider][14] to the grid, and in the for loop, we call the *osSignalWait()* function. 
This is an example of an inter-thread communication mechanism - another reason to use a full-fledged 
RTOS. So this code will block till it get the signal that it's expecting. Once it gets the signal, 
it will call the *update()* method which updates the simulation by one time step.

You may recall that we called *conway.signal()* in the main task. Here's what it does:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/b7c663a191b59f1f5421408f14b9b3ac.js"></script>

This is the call that wakes up the blocked execution in the conway task.

And now for the core of the simulation - the update function:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/electronut/b55c3eb28ab9d419b8721c9c095326fe.js"></script>

I won't go into the details of *Game Of Life* here. I've written an entire chapter on it in 
my book [Python Playground][13]. The above code updates the grid according to the rules of the 
game and the *MAX7219* object is used to send this updated grid to the 8x8 LED grid.

## Conclusion

I think System Workbench + STM32CubeMX + FreeRTOS + C++ gives you a good framework for building 
complex application on STM32 microcontrollers.
