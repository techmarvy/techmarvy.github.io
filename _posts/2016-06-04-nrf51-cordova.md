## Introduction

Last year, I had written a [rather ponderous article][9] on the *Device* part of
the IoT triad consisting of *Device*, *Mobile* and *Cloud*. This time,
I want to focus on the *Mobile* part. In this article, I'll go through the
construction of a cross platform mobile app that displays *heart rate measurement* data sent
by a Nordic nRF51822 *device* via BLE. I'll throw in a bit of *cloud* as well -
by periodically posting this data to *thingspeak*.

## nRF51 Programming

There is no firmware development in this article. I'll be assuming that you
have an nRF51 device, and that you have programmed it with the [ble_app_hrs][10]
example from Nordic.

If you are unfamiliar with nRF51 development, you might want to look through
some of my previous articles on the subject:

* [Hacking a Cheap LED Lamp with nRF51822][8]
* [nRF51822 Begins - nRF-DK, GCC, ADC, UART/BLE][1]
* [External nRF51822 SWD Programming using the nRF51-DK][2]
* [nRF51-DK PWM & GPIOTE test with S110 SoftDevice][3]
* [Talking to Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04 using nRF51822][4]
* [Controlling an RGB LED with Nordic nRF51-DK (nRF51822/nRF51422)][5]
* [Motor Control over BLE with nRF51822 and TB6612FNG][6]
* [BLEBot - nRF51822 based BLE Robot][7]

Now let's look at the *mobile* part.

## Cross Platform Mobile Apps

At the beginning of my career in the late 90s, I spent most of my time porting
applications from Unix to Windows. Cross Platform development was a mess, and
my job felt like taking apart one watch to stuff it into another, losing
parts in the process. In 2016, writing portable code is still a wretched affair, but there is a
glimmer of hope as Web Tech, with JavaScript at the helm, is emerging
as the winner. (I don't know about you, but I am tired of learning syntax for
yet another programming language.)

For the Mobile universe, there are various cross platform solutions out there -
*PhoneGap*, *React Native*, *Ionic/Angular*, *Xamarin* - just to name a few.
After reading through some of this technology (and doubling my number of
grey hairs), I decided to go with plain *Cordova* - which is actually the basis
for many of the frameworks above, and uses HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to help
you develop cross platform mobile apps. (For folks who want a quick start for
  their IoT devices, I recommend exploring [evothings][17], which is also based
  on *cordova*.)

## Mobile App Development

Now let's get into the nitty-gritty of developing the mobile app.

### Objective

Our goal is to create a mobile app that does the following:

1. Scan for BLE devices
2. Connect to Heart Rate Service on a device
3. Enable notifications
4. Display current heart rate
4. Plot heart rate as a function of time
5. Post data periodically to ThingSpeak

Let's get on with the setup.

### Cordova setup

I won't cover *cordova* here, but the [official documentation][12] is quite good,
and you can start there. For this project, the most important thing is that you
need to get the [cordova-plugin-ble-central][13] plugin. Your setup will roughly
look like the following:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
$cordova create nrf51HRM com.electronut.nrf51HRM nrf51HRM
$cd nrf51HRM
$cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-ble-central
$cordova platform add android
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The above was done on OS X which required *sudo* on cordova commands. (Fixable,
  but life is short, and there's too much to do.) Also, a long term iPhone
  user, I finally decided to ditch iOS and get an Android (Nexus 5X)
using this project as an excuse - the main reason being that I am tired of paying developer
fees to the demigods at *Infinite Loop* just so I can put apps on my own darn
device. If you use iOS, you will need to add that platform above.

Next, you'll need to setup your platform (iOS or Android) for development.
That's beyond the scope of this article, but there are many resources to help
you out there. Again, the *Cordova* official documentation has nice sections on
platform setup.

After the setup, here's what the directory structure looks like:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
$ tree -L 2 nrf51HRM/
nrf51HRM/
├── config.xml
├── hooks
│   └── README.md
├── platforms
│   ├── android
│   └── platforms.json
├── plugins
│   ├── android.json
│   ├── cordova-plugin-ble-central
│   ├── cordova-plugin-compat
│   ├── cordova-plugin-whitelist
│   └── fetch.json
└── www
    ├── css
    ├── index.html
    └── js
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

All our action is in the *www* directory. Once you are done with setup, you
need to replace the contents of the *www* directory with my code which you can
find in the *Downloads* section below.

Here's what my *www* looks like:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
$ tree -L 4 nrf51HRM/www
nrf51HRM/www
├── css
│   └── index.css
├── index.html
└── js
    ├── index.js
    └── jquery
        ├── jquery.js
        └── version.txt
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

*index.html* contains the layout of your app, which is styled by *index.css*.
The logic for your app resides in *index.js*. We use *jquery* in this project,
so you need that as well.

Now that you are setup, here's how you build and upload the code to your
mobile device:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
$cordova build android
$cordova run android
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

I had trouble running this on the emulator, and BLE may not work with the
emulator anyway. So I suggest that you just plug in the mobile and work with
it right from start.  

### Debugging

Having a good debugging tool saves you a lot of time on development. Midway
through this project, I was delighted to discover this *Chrome* trick - with
your mobile connected via USB to your computer and running the app, go to
*chrome://inspect/?#devices* on your computer. It will list your app, and
you can click on *inspect* to get a developer console. How cool is that?!
Here's a session:

![debug cordova](/images/2016/06/debug-cordova.png "debug cordova")

Now let's look at the code.

### The Layout

Everything starts at *index.html*, which starts by setting up some parameters
and loading scripts inside *<head>*.

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no" />
  <meta name="msapplication-tap-highlight" content="no" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="user-scalable=no, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, width=device-width, height=device-height, target-densitydpi=device-dpi" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/index.css" />
  <title>Heart Rate</title>

  <script type="text/javascript" src="cordova.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="js/index.js"></script>
</head>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can see above where the JavaScript files are loaded. Now for the main
content:

{% highlight html %}
{% raw %}
<body>
   <div>
       <h2>Heart Rate</h2>
       <div id="beatsPerMinute">...</div>
       <div id="statusDiv"></div>
       <button id="button-connect" onclick="app.connectBtn()">CONNECT</button>
   </div>
   <canvas id="canvas" width="600" height="200"></canvas>
 </body>
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The layout above is simple - just a heading, *<div>s* for heart rate and status,
a *connect* button, and an HTML5 *canvas* for drawing the graph.

Now let's go to the action part.

### JS Action

*index.js* is where the action happens. Let's look at the important snippets
within.

#### Talking to BLE

When you click the *connect* button, the BLE scan is started here:

{% highlight js %}
{% raw %}
app.scan = function() {
  app.status("Scanning for Heart Rate Monitor");

  // hanlder for scan success
  function onScan(peripheral) {

    // assume only one peripheral sending heart rate

    console.log("Found " + JSON.stringify(peripheral));
    app.status("Found " + peripheral.name);

    // save peripheral
    app.peripheral = peripheral;

    // on successful connection
    function onConnect(peripheral) {
      app.status("Connected to " + peripheral.name);
      // start heart rate notification
      ble.startNotification(peripheral.id, '180D', '2A37', app.onData, app.onError);
      // set flag
      app.connected = true;
    }

    // on connection failure
    function onFailure (reason) {
      beatsPerMinute.innerHTML = "...";
      console.log("disconnected: " + reason);
      app.status("Disconnected!");
      app.connected = false;
      $('#button-connect').html('CONNECT');
    }

    // connect to peripheral
    ble.connect(peripheral.id, onConnect, onFailure);

    // set button text
    $('#button-connect').html('DISCONNECT');
  }

  // handler for scan failure
  function scanFailure(reason) {
    app.status("Did not find a heart rate monitor.");
    $('#button-connect').html('CONNECT');
  }

  // scan for heartrate service, 0x180D
  // https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/services/Pages/ServiceViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml
  ble.scan(['180D'], 5, onScan, scanFailure);
};

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you are new to JavaScript, the "functions within functions" style of
writing code as seen above might look incomprehensible, till you realize as
Douglas Crockford said, that [JavaScript is Lisp in C's clothing][14]. I highly
recommend that you read his book *JavaScript: The Good Parts* to get a feel for the
actual power of this language.

In the above code, *ble.scan()* starts looking for BLE devices, and we're
filtering for the service id *0x180D*, which is a [predefined bluetooth service][15]
for sending heart rate information. Each time a device with this service is
found, the *onConnect()* function is called, which calls *ble.startNotification()*
on the heart rate characteristic with id *0x2A37* - this is the actual heart
rate measurement. Setting the notification will make the device send the data
periodically to the app. This data will be made available through the *onData()*
function passed in. Here's what it looks like:

{% highlight js %}
{% raw %}
// called on receiving characteristic data
app.onData = function(buffer) {

  var hrm = new Uint8Array(buffer);

  // parse heart rate
  // see:
  // https://developer.bluetooth.org/gatt/characteristics/Pages/CharacteristicViewer.aspx?u=org.bluetooth.characteristic.heart_rate_measurement.xml

  if(hrm[0] & 0x1) {
    // 16-bit
    app.heartRate = (hrm[2] << 8) + hrm[1];
  }
  else {
    // 8-bit
    app.heartRate = hrm[1];
  }

  // set heart rate display
  beatsPerMinute.innerHTML = app.heartRate;

  // draw graph
  app.plot(app.heartRate);
};
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

To understand the format of the data sent by the heart rate measurement
characteristic, please take a look at the [official specification][16]. The
Nordic *ble_app_hrs* firmware sends heart rate in 16-bit format, and the code
above handles it by combining data from the two adjacent bytes. Once parsed,
the value is set to the text display and then passed on to the *app.plot()*
function.

In addition to the above, the status messages are set based on various
conditions, like connect, disconnect, failures, etc.

Now let's look at plotting a graph using the heart rate data.

#### Drawing a Graph

For display the heart rate data, we create a "rolling graph" of points
(represented as filled circles). As new data comes in, old data moves to the
right.

Here's the *app.plot()* function where the drawing to the HTML5 canvas happens.

{% highlight js %}
{% raw %}
app.plot = function(heartRate) {

  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  var context = canvas.getContext('2d');
  var dataPoints = app.dataPoints;
  var maxLen = 50;

  // add data
  dataPoints.push(heartRate);
  // cap length
  if (dataPoints.length > maxLen) {
    // remove first
    dataPoints.splice(0, 1);
  }

  // maximum value
  var maxVal = 400;

  function drawPoints(color)
  {
    // draw dots
    context.fillStyle = color;
    context.strokeStyle = color;
    var x = 0;
    for (var i = dataPoints.length-1; i> 0; i--) {
      context.beginPath();
      var y = canvas.height - (dataPoints[i] * canvas.height) / maxVal;
      context.arc(x, y, 4, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
      context.fill();
      x += 10;
    }
  }

  // clear previous
  context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

  drawPoints("green");
};
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, new data is added to the *dataPoints* array as they come in.
A *splice* is done when the count exceeds *maxLen* to keep the number of points
drawn constant. The function *drawPoints()* does the actual drawing, using the
*arc()* method of the canvas context. *x+=10;* ensures a certain distance between
the points on the horizontal axis.

Now for some cloud mischief.

#### Posting Data to ThingSpeak

[Thingspeak][18] is a great platform for plotting your IoT data. It's free,
and lets you create channels for your data, and provides convenient export
options for all your data. You're allowed to update your channel every 15
seconds only - something to remember. Here's the code that posts data there,
from the *$(document).ready()* function:

{% highlight js %}
{% raw %}
// AJAX callback
function onDataReceived(jsonData) {
  app.status("Thingspeak post: " + JSON.stringify(jsonData));
}
// AJAX error handler
function onError(){
  app.status("Ajax error!");
}

// get data from server
function getData() {
  if(app.connected) {
    // prepare thingspeak URL
    // set up a thingspeak channel and change the write key below
    var key = 'IKYH9WWZLG5TVYF2'
    var urlTS = 'https://api.thingspeak.com/update?api_key=' + key + '&field1=' + app.heartRate;
    // make the AJAX call
    $.ajax({
      url: urlTS,
      type: "GET",
      dataType: "json",
      success: onDataReceived,
      error: onError
      });
    }
  }
  // define an update function
  var count = 0;
  function update() {
    // get data
    getData();
    // set timeout - thingspeak can only update every 15 seconds
    setTimeout(update, 16000);
  }
  // call update
  update();
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, we're using a simple *AJAX* setup to make a 'GET' call into
the thingspeak channel to update our channel. *jquery* makes this job easy. We
use the *setTimeout()* method to call this code every 16 seconds. The data
returned from the *GET* call is displayed in the status text.

You'll need to setup your own thingspeak channel for testing, as I've changed
the write API key to mine - no naughty business. :-)

Here's a sample output:

![nrf51-thingspeak](/images/2016/06/nrf51-thingspeak.png "nrf51-thingspeak")

And thus we have our BLE device not only talking to our own mobile app, but
using it as a conduit to post data on to the cloud yonder.

## Conclusion

We've touched on the *Mobile* part of the IoT triad by building a cross
platform mobile application that talks to a BLE device. I think *cordova* is
a good place to start - especially in an IoT context. The concepts learned
here can be leveraged as you move to other platforms like *Ionic/Angular*.
