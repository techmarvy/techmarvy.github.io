![nRF-DK LDR UART](/images/2015/07/nrf-ldr-main.jpg "nRF-DK LDR UART")

## Introduction

The nRF51822 is a very popular SoC (System on a Chip) which integrates
BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) with an ARM Cortex M0 CPU. For folks like
myself trudging along in 8-bit AVR country, 32-bit ARM development is
unfamiliar territory. The chips are powerful, complex beasts, and the
hardware and software infrastucture required to program them are
tortuous and often absurdly priced. For nRF51822, you have the burden
of understanding the BLE jargon as well.

To clear the fog in my head, I wanted to create a simple project using
nRF51822 that reads light levels from an LDR and sends the data over
BLE. In the process, I set up the development environment on Windows
and OS X. Hopefully this will serve as a useful guide for you to get
started on this chip.

## Hardware

The best hardware you can buy to get started with the nRF51822 is the
official [nRF51-DK kit][5] from Nordic which costs about USD 70. It might
be tempting get a cheap nRF51822 breakout board and hack with it. But
the official kit has some major advantages:

1. nRF51-DK comes with a [Segger J-Link OB][8] - built-in JTAG that
is. This is an opportunity for learning the industry-standard way of
programming, debugging and testing these kind of chips.
2. nRF51-DK has 4 leds, 4 buttons, a coin cell holder, and female headers
broken out for all the nRF51422 pins. A great platform for prototyping.
3. The built-in JTAG adapter can be used for external programming. So once
you are done with prototyping and want to program your nRF51822 custom
board, you don't need any other hardware.
4. Being the official board, it has vast support and documentation
from Nordic and the developer community.

When you get the board, it might unsettle you (like it did me) that
the chip seen on the board is the nRF51422 and not nRF51822. Fear not, as
the former chip is a superset of the latter, and unless you are
messing with the ANT protocol, anything you write on this board will
work fine on an nRF51822.

By the way, this board is known as *PCA10028* - you'll encounter this name all over the place.

## Software

To start development, get the following:

1. [Nordic nRF51 SDK][1]. As of this writing the latest version is 8.1.0.
2. [Segger J-Link command utility][2] for your platform.
3. [ARM GCC compiler][3].

You notice above that I picked GCC for development
above. Unfortunately the ARM world is filled with proprietory, closed
source, horribly expensive software. Fortunately Nordic has done a
fabulous job supporting the Open Source ARM GCC toolchain, which is
what we will be taking advantage of.

It's a good idea to take a look at the contents of the nRF51 SDK
folder. Nordic seems to have changed this at least once, and I have
found that many articles on toolchain setup refer to a now-obsolete
directory structure.

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We'll need to modify the Makefiles in *components/toolchain/gcc*. The
Nordic samples are in *examples* which is our fundamental
reference. The *SoftDevice* we are going to use is in the
*softdevice/s110* directory.

## Setting up on Windows

Nordic assumes that you will most likely use ARM Keil tools for
development on Windows, and hence the documentation is skewed towards
it. ARM graciously provides a 32k code limited version free of
charge. And when you want to upgrade to their commercial
non-restricted version, you can just fork over something in the
neighborhood of [USD 4900][7] for a license. Thankfully, there is an
alternative: GCC.

Developing with GCC requires the Unix *make* and associated
tools. Although you can get *make* by itself, I recommend that instead
you install [GNU MSYS][4] which gives you a Unix-like environment
within Windows. (This is in fact the first piece of sotware that I
install on any new Windows machine.)

The next thing you need to do is to modify
*components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.windows*. Here's what mine looks
like:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
ifeq ($(findstring 86, $(ProgramFiles)), )
        PROGFILES := C:/Program Files
else
        PROGFILES := C:/Program Files (x86)
endif

GNU_INSTALL_ROOT := C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.9 2015q1
GNU_VERSION := 4.9.3
GNU_PREFIX := arm-none-eabi
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, put the Segger J-Link into your *PATH* environement variable. On my system, the path is *C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\JLink_V498c*.

## Setting up on OS X

OS X has Unix underneath, so you already have *make* and other
goodies. You need to modify *components/toolchain/gcc/Makefile.posix*
as follows:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
GNU_INSTALL_ROOT := /usr/local/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q1
GNU_VERSION := 4.9.3
GNU_PREFIX := arm-none-eabi
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Make sure the paths and version match above, for your system.

## The Code

It's common for people to put their project into the toolchain example
directory, in parallel with existing projects. But I find this to be
messy. What happens when you get the next version of the SDK? Besides,
the Makefile scheme easily lets you put your code wherever you
want. In my case, I am putting the project's code in a directory
parallel to the SDK directory.

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
klaatu:nRF51 mahesh$ pwd
/Users/mahesh/Documents/code/nRF51
klaatu:nRF51 mahesh$ ls -1
nRF51-adc-test
nRF51_SDK_8.1.0_b6ed55f
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

So correspondingly, in the project Makefile, you will see:

{% highlight sh %}
{% raw %}
SDK_ROOT = ../../../../nRF51_SDK_8.1.0_b6ed55f
TEMPLATE_PATH = $(SDK_ROOT)/components/toolchain/gcc
SOFTDEVICE_HEX = $(SDK_ROOT)/components/softdevice/s110/hex/s110_softdevice.hex
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can modify the above as you see fit.

### Software Layers

ARM Cortex M Programming is complicated, and so is BLE. To get going,
you need to familiarize yourselves with the different layers of
software used, and how they interact with each other. You will have to
refer to the extensive [nRF51 SDK documentation][9] to make sense of
all this.

The first thing to understand with nRF51 is the *SoftDevice*
concept. According to Nordic, "The SoftDevice is a precompiled and
linked binary software implementing a Bluetooth 4.1 low energy
protocol stack for the nRF51 series of chips." You can see below how
it sits in relation to the application code.

![nRF51 S110 SoftDevice](/images/2015/07/nrf51-s110.png "S110 SoftDevice")

In general, your programming flow will consist of flashing the
SoftDevice on to the chip (need to do this only once), and then
flashing your application code on top. (We're using *S110* here, but
Nordic has other types of SoftDevices too.)

As you saw in the graphic above, just above the hardware is CMSIS,
which stands for *Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard*
- this is a vendor-independent hardware abstraction layer from ARM
that simplifies programming and reduces development time for these
chips.

On top of CMSIS, Nordic has provided a huge bunch of libraries. BLE,
peripherals, board support, softdevice, bootloader - just to name a
few. You just have to [read the documentation][9] - no way around
this!

## Program Structure

As with other microcontrollers, the program for our project consists
of a main loop:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// Application main function.
int main(void)
{
    uint32_t err_code;

    // set up timer
    APP_TIMER_INIT(0, (2 + BSP_APP_TIMERS_NUMBER), 4, false);

    // initlialize BLE
    ble_stack_init();
    gap_params_init();
    services_init();
    advertising_init();
    conn_params_init();
    err_code = ble_advertising_start(BLE_ADV_MODE_FAST);
    APP_ERROR_CHECK(err_code);

    // intialize UART
    uart_init();

    // prints to serial port
    printf("starting...\n");

    // set up ADC
    adc_config();
    nrf_adc_start();

    // set LED1 connected to P0.22 as output
    uint32_t pinNum = 22;
    //nrf_gpio_cfg_output(pinNum);
    nrf_gpio_pin_dir_set(pinNum, NRF_GPIO_PIN_DIR_OUTPUT);
    // Enter main loop.
    while(1) {

      // flash LED2 once
      nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinNum);
      nrf_delay_ms(100);
      nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinNum);
      nrf_delay_ms(100);

      // send ADC value via NUS (Nordic UART service)
      uint8_t str[4];
      sprintf((char*)str, "%d", (int)adc_sample);
      ble_nus_string_send(&m_nus, str, strlen((char*)str));
    }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the code above, we start by intializing BLE - GAP, advertizing,
etc. The *services_init()* call initializes the BLE NUS (Nordic UART
Service) which is what we will use to send data over BLE. Next, we
initialize UART which can be used for printing debug messages. The
next step is to initialize ADC. Then we come to the loop, where in
each iteration we (a) flash LED #2 and (b) Send the ADC data over
NUS. You can look at the full source to see how the above functions
are implemented.

## Building and Uploading the Code

First you need to upload the SoftDevice on to the chip. (You need to do this only once.)

### Testing

Here is how you hook up your LDR resistor divider:

![nRF51 LDR](/images/2015/07/nrf-ldr.png "nRF51 LDR")

To test the BLE device you just created, you can use the [Nordic
nRFToolbox App][11]. You can see it in action in the video below:
