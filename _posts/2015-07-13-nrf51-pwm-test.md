## Prerequisite

Before you read further, please take a look at my [previous article on
nRF51-DK programming using GCC][1], since we're going to use the same
setup here.

## PWM

This is a simple example that demonstrates PWM, GPIOTE, and NUS (Nordic UART
Service) using the S110 softdevice on the nRF51-DK. This example uses
the nRF51 SDK version 9.0.0. To use it, modify
*pca10028/s110/armgcc/Makefile* to point *SDK_ROOT* to your nRF51 SDK
directory.

I have tried to remove all unnecessary layers (like the Nordic BSP
support) to make this example simple to understand. It uses instances
*PWM1* and *PWM2* associated with *Timer1* and *Timer2* respectively,
and each of them support two PWM channels each. I have used pins 21,
22, 23, 24 for these channels, corresponding to LED1, LED2, LED3 and
LED4 on the nRF51-DK (PCA10028) board. Notice that to use these timers, I
have enabled them in *config/nrf_drv_config.h*.

When you upload this code, the LEDs will pulse as shown in the above
video. In addition, if you press the switches *SW1* and *SW2* on the
board, it will toggle PWM on *LED1* and *LED2* respectively. *SW1*
works by reading the actual value of pin 17, whereas *SW2* works using
GPIOTE events.

You will also see this appear as a BLE device
called *PWM* and you will be able to communicate with it using UART
over BLE using the Nordic nRFToolbox app.
