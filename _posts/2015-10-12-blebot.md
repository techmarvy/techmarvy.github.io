## Introduction

In this project, we will build a two-wheeled robot based on the Nordic
nRF51822 BLE SoC. Motor control for the two wheels of the robot will
be done using an L293D chip. The robot can be controlled using any
mobile device that has BLE, and when not connected, it switches to an
autonomous mode, avoiding obstacles using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic
sensor.

## Background

Before you read further, you might want to look through some of my
previous articles on nRF51822 programming, since we're going to use
similar concepts and development setup here.

* [nRF51822 Begins - nRF-DK, GCC, ADC, UART/BLE][1]
* [External nRF51822 SWD Programming using the nRF51-DK][2]
* [nRF51-DK PWM & GPIOTE test with S110 SoftDevice][3]
* [Talking to Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04 using nRF51822][4]
* [Controlling an RGB LED with Nordic nRF51-DK (nRF51822/nRF51422)][5]
* [Motor Control over BLE with nRF51822 and TB6612FNG][6]

## Hardware & Connections

Here's the list of hardware you need for this project:

1. An nRF51822 Module.
2. An nRF51822 Module Adapter (optional).
3. L293D motor driver IC.
4. Two wheel robot chassis with two motors.
5. HC-SR05 ultrasonic sensor.
6. A regulator IC like LM7805.
7. A LiPo battery or similar which can supply enough voltage and current for the motors and the module.

The type of nRF51822 module I used is made in China, and available at
sites like *aliexpress*, and they come with two 2x9 2 mm pitch
headers. These are awfully hard to use, so I (in collaboration with
my friend Sandeep) designed an adapter to make them breadboard
friendly. These are optional for this project, but they are [available
for purchase on Tindie][11] if you would like to check them out. In 
addition to making the module easy to use, our adapter also has a 
built-in LED and a voltage regulator.

Here's how I hooked up the L293D and the nRF51822. (These connections 
are consistent with my code. If you do them differently, update the 
code to match.)

| nRF51822| L293D| Other |
|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| P0.01  | 1 | N/A |
| P0.02 | 2 | N/A |
| P0.03 | 7 | N/A |
| P0.04|  9 | N/A |
| P0.05 | 15 | N/A |
| P0.06 | 10 | N/A |
| P0.07 | N/A | HC-SR04 Trig|
| P0.23 | N/A | HC-SR04 Echo via resistor divider|
| P0.21 | N/A | LED |
| GND | N/A | GND |
| VDD | N/A | 3.3 V |
| N/A | 4, 5, 12, 13| GND |
| N/A | 3, 6| motor#1 |
| N/A |11, 14| motor#2 |
| N/A |8, 16| VCC|

Note above that HC-SR05 runs on 5V, and nRF51822 on 3.3 V. So you need 
to ensure that the *Echo* signal from HC-SR05 is reduced from 5V TTL 
to 3.3V TTL, and the simplest way to do that is using a resistor divider, 
as explained in [my previous article on using HC-SR04 with nRF51822][4].

For power supply, I used 4 x 1.5 V alkaline batteries. I supplied 5V to the
L293D using a 7805 regulator, and since [my nRF51822 adapter][11]
already has a built in regulator (and an LED), so I powered it
separately from a 9V battery. I recommend that you use a good 
capacity 7.4 V LiPo battery to power this project.

## nRF51822 Chip Versions & SDK

You need to ensure that the chip version, the Nordic nRF51 SDK, and
the SoftDevice versions are compatible. The two documents you need to
check this are the *Product Anomaly Notice* and the *nRF51 Series
Compatibility Matrix* - both available from Nordic website or a web
search.

From these documents, here's how you identify the chip:

![nrf51-chip-markings](/images/2015/07/nrf51-chip-markings.png "nrf51-chip-markings")

In my case, the chip on the module says QFACA2 and 1513AN. So it has 256 kB flash, 32 kB RAM, and it was made in 2015. This information is very important, and the *ld* file needs to be consistent with the chip. Here are the contents of my *ld* file:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
/* Linker script to configure memory regions. */

SEARCH_DIR(.)
GROUP(-lgcc -lc -lnosys)

MEMORY
{
  FLASH (rx) : ORIGIN = 0x18000, LENGTH = 0x28000
  RAM (rwx) :  ORIGIN = 0x20002000, LENGTH = 0x6000
}

INCLUDE "gcc_nrf51_common.ld"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's how you identify the chip revisions:

![nrf51-chip-versions](/images/2015/10/nrf51-chip-versions.png "nrf51-chip-versions")

And here's a graphic that shows the SDK compatibility:

![nrf51-SDK-compatibility](/images/2015/10/nrf51-sdk-compatibility.png "nrf51-SDK-compatibility")

In my case, I am using the Nordic nRF51 SDK version **8.1.0** for this project.

## The Code

I'll go through the highlights of the code here, but you'll need to go
through the github link in *Downloads* below for the full picture. In
addition to the Nordic SDK files, the code for BLEBot is organized in
these files:

* main.c
* ble_int.h
* ble_init.c
* distance.h
* distance.c

### The Main Loop

Here is the main loop of BLEBot:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
while(1) {
        if(is_connected()) {

            // stop if coming from an unconnected state
            if(!prevStateConnected) {
                stop();
            }

            // execute command if any 
            if(bbEvent.pending) {
                handle_bbevent(&bbEvent);
            }

            // flash LED twice quick
            nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(100);
            nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(100);
            nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(100);
            nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(100);

            prevStateConnected = true;
        }
        else {            

            // start moving if previous state was connected
            if (prevStateConnected) {
                set_dir(true);
                set_speed(0, 80);
                set_speed(1, 80);
            }

            // move robot autonomously
            auto_move();

            // flash LED once
            nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(500);
            nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinLED);
            nrf_delay_ms(500);

            prevStateConnected = false;
        }
    }
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above loop, if the BLE connection is active, the robot follows
instructions sent via the Nordic UART Service (NUS) from the mobile
device. In this mode, it moves in reponse to *left*, *right*, *stop*,
*reverse*, and *start*. I use the [Nordic nRFToolBox app][7] for using
NUS.  I also flash the LED connected to *P0.21* twice quickly in each
iteration of the loop.

Here's the NUS data handler that takes action based on data 
that comes in via BLE.

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// Function for handling the data from the Nordic UART Service.
static void nus_data_handler(ble_nus_t * p_nus, uint8_t * p_data, 
                             uint16_t length)
{
  // clear events
  bbEvent.pending = false;

  if (strstr((char*)(p_data), REWIND)) {
    bbEvent.pending = true;
    bbEvent.event = eBBEvent_Left;
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), FORWARD)) {
    bbEvent.pending = true;
    bbEvent.event = eBBEvent_Right;
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), STOP)) {
    bbEvent.pending = true;
    bbEvent.event = eBBEvent_Stop;
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), PLAY)) {
    bbEvent.pending = true;
    bbEvent.event = eBBEvent_Start;
    bbEvent.data = 80;
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), SHUFFLE)) {
    bbEvent.pending = true;
    bbEvent.event = eBBEvent_Reverse;
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, the motor states are changed based on the commands that 
come in. (These strings are tailored to the Nordic nRF Toolbox app, but 
you can change them to suite your mobile app.) It's not a good idea to 
do any heavy lifting from BLE event callbacks, so all I do when I 
get an event is set a pending flag and the event type. The actual handling 
is done in the main loop, as you saw before. 

Here is the data structure used for events:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// events
typedef enum _BBEventType {
    eBBEvent_Start,
    eBBEvent_Stop,
    eBBEvent_Reverse,
    eBBEvent_Left,
    eBBEvent_Right,
} BBEventType;
// structure handle pending events
typedef struct _BBEvent
{
    bool pending;
    BBEventType event;
    int data;
} BBEvent;

BBEvent bbEvent;
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The idea is that you can set a one-shot *pending* flag and the event
type, which can be checked in the main loop and handled.

Here is the handler code for motion control.

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// handle event
void handle_bbevent(BBEvent* bbEvent)
{
    switch(bbEvent->event) {
        case eBBEvent_Start:
        {
            set_dir(curr_dir);
            set_speed(0, bbEvent->data);
            set_speed(1, bbEvent->data);
        }
        break;

        case eBBEvent_Stop:
        {
            stop();
        }
        break;

        case eBBEvent_Left:
        {
            turn(false, 500);
        }
        break;

        case eBBEvent_Right:
        {
            turn(true, 500);
        }
        break;

        case eBBEvent_Reverse:
        {
            set_dir(!curr_dir);
        }
        break;

        default:
            break;
    }

    // clear 
    bbEvent->pending = false;
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The motion of the motors is controlled by sending the correct signal 
to the *L293D* (The *D* indicates that the IC has built-in flyback
diodes.), which is configured as a dual H-bridge driver,
controlling both the direction and speed of two connected motors.
The speed is controlled by changing the PWM duty cycle on the *A* pins,
and the direction of rotation is by setting the *EN* pins to *HIGH* 
or *LOW*. For example, this is how you set the direction of motion:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
void set_dir(bool forward)
{
  if(forward) {
    // set direction A
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinIN2);
    // set direction B
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN3);
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinIN4);
  }
  else {
     // set direction A
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN2);
    // set direction B
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinIN3);
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN4);
  }
  curr_dir = forward;
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Above, we use the *GPIO* pins to set the direction of the motors. Here's 
how you set the motor speeds:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
void set_speed(int motor, uint8_t speed)
{
  // error check
  if (motor < 0 || motor > 1)
    return;

  // set speed
  while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, motor, speed) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
  motor_speeds[motor] = speed; 

  stopped = false;
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

To set speed, you just set the PWM duty cycle. And here's how you turn:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
void turn(bool left, int tms)
{
  if(left) {
    // stop motor 0
    int tmp = motor_speeds[0];
    set_speed(0, 0);
    set_speed(1, 50);
    // wait
    nrf_delay_ms(tms);
    // reset 
    set_speed(0, tmp);
    set_speed(1, tmp);
  }
  else {
    // stop motor 1
    int tmp = motor_speeds[1];
    set_speed(1, 0);
    set_speed(0, 50);
    // wait
    nrf_delay_ms(tms);
    // reset 
    set_speed(0, tmp);
    set_speed(1, tmp);
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

To turn, you just reduce the speed of one motor for the specified 
time in milliseconds. And here's how you stop:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
void stop()
{
  // set direction A
  nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN1);
  nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN2);
    
  // set direction B
  nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN3);
  nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinIN4);

  stopped = true;
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The above methods are all you need to drive the robot around.

If BLE connection is inactive, the robot goes into an autonomous mode 
using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles. It uses a 
very simple algorithm: if it detects an object at a distance less than 
a certain threshold, it stops, reverses, turns left, and continues on.
In this mode, I also flash the LED slower, so it's easy to see whether 
the robot is connected via BLE or not.

Here's the simple logic that is used to move the robot autonomously.

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
void auto_move()
{
    // get HC-SR04 distance
    float dist = 1.0;
    if(getDistance(&dist)) {

        // obstacle avoidance
        if (dist < 15) {
         
            // stop 
            stop();

            // reverse 
            set_dir(false);
            set_speed(0, 50);
            set_speed(1, 50);
            nrf_delay_ms(1000);

            // turn left 
            turn(true, 500);

            // go
            set_dir(true);
            set_speed(0, 80);
            set_speed(1, 80);
        }
    }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, if the distance from the ultrasonic sensor is 
less than a certain threshold, we stop the motors, reverse, turn, 
and then continue on forward. Nothing too fancy, but it does work. 
I have written previously on [interfacing the nRF51822 with the HC-SR04 
ultrasonic sensor][4], so I won't repeat it here. The distance 
computation code is in *distance.c*.

## Uploading Code to the nRF51822

To program the nRF51822 module, you need to use an SWD programmer. I
can't go into details here, but if you have the Nordic nRF51-DK, you
can read my article on [nRF51-DK external SWD programming][8] to get
started. You can use other tools to do the job also. For example,
here's an nRF51822 project that [uses an st-link programmer][9].


## In Action

Here's BLeBot in action:

And here's a view of some of the signals in BLEBot (Saleae Logic 8).

![blebot-saleae](/images/2015/10/blebot-saleae.png "blebot-saleae")

I think it's quite impressive that this tiny Nordic SoC can handle 
an ultrasonic sensor, control two motors, blink an LED, and handle BLE 
communications at the same time.
