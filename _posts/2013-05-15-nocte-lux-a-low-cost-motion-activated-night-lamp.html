<p>No, it's not the $10000 Leica lens of similar name. ;-)</p>
<p>For this project, I wanted to try and make a simple night lamp â€“ something that you can put under your cot and use it simply by picking it up. Useful in case you get up in the middle of the night and need a quick light. So I used a tilt switch and a 555 IC to design the circuit.</p>
<p>I used SMD components for this project for compactness. If you haven't done any SMD soldering before, don't be intimidated by it. You can solder many types of SMD packages (SOT23, TQFP, 1206, etc) using just a soldering iron with a small chisel tip, and a pair of tweezers. If you add a hot air rework station to your tools, you can even solder tiny QFN packages which have all leads under the device. </p>
<p>Here is a very informative and entertaining <a href="http://www.siliconfarmers.com/smtmanga/">cartoon guide to SMD soldering</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a video of the project:</p>
