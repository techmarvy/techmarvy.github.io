## AVR to ARM

My first introduction to microcontrollers was via the Arduino platform.
But I soon started digging a little deeper and got into (8-bit) AVR programming. I was especially
fascinated with the tinyAVR line, which I still think of as tiny computers that I
can (almost) wrap my head around. I was hearing more and more about 32-bit ARM Cortex-M processors, but was intimidated by the apparent complexity of programming these chips. As I started working with connected devices like Nordic nRF51/52 (BLE) and TI CC3200 (WiFi),
I got introduced to the concept of SoC - System On a Chip, where the radio was paired with a
processor - often an ARM Cortex-M. Then came the Arduino Zero (and compatible boards like the Neutrino) which adopted the Atmel SAMD21 ARM Cortex-M0+ chip. So I started getting familiar
with ARM, but the various layers of libraries and tools I used hid the ARM architecture from me.

In my view, an obvious advantage of ARM compared to (8-bit) AVR was superior capabilities -
faster processor speeds, more number of peripherals like ADCs and GPIOs, USB,
support for RTOS (Real Time Operating Systems), etc. But another surprising discovery
was the cost factor. 32 bit ARM processors were actually **cheaper** than 8-bit AVRs!
So if you were developing a product, the writing was on the wall. It was becoming
a necessity to learn about these processors.

## Pick an ARM, Code an ARM

Programming AVRs was a walk in the park. Just download *avrdude* + *avr-gcc*, get a cheap
USB programmer, and you were set. Compared to that, developing for ARM is
like trying to stroll in the middle of a raging battlefield. First, you need to choose
an ARM chip - Cortex-M0, Cortex-M3, etc. Then, you need to choose a vendor
- Atmel, ST, NXP, Microchip, etc., and go through their scary variety of offerings to
make your final selection. Next comes the choice of a development board
for your chip - either one with an integrated debugger (eg. J-LINK OB, ST-Link),
or separate board and generic debugger (eg. J-Link). (The hardware helps you
debug your code running in the chip, as well as upload it to the flash memory.)
And then comes the most fun - selecting development tools for your chip.
"Professional" tools for ARM program are, for the lack of a more apt adjective,
obscenely priced - like a few thousand US dollars.(Vendors
  also offer free code size limited versions of their expensive Pro tools.)
Fortunately, Open Source comes to the rescue again, in the form of ARM GCC, OpenOCD and Eclipse.
You can read a [rather lengthy discussion on this topic here][5].

Once you have decided all of the above, you still have to make a choice on how
to structure your code - use "bare metal" (just registers + C), vendor's HAL or
middleware, CMSIS, or maybe go "full me(n)tal" and code in assembly.

My own experience with selecting an ARM Cortex-M3 chip went as follows: I trawled
through various internet forums for posts that compared
Atmel vs. NXP vs. ST vs. Microchip vs. WhateverARM. After a couple of days,
I was convinced of one thing - we humans are an unhappy lot,
and can't agree on anything. So I made my choice solely based on economics -
ST has the lowest price on ARM chips - especially if I source them from China.

So in the end, I decided to begin my ARM journey with the STM32F103 ARM Cortex-M3
chip from STMicroelectronics.

## Getting Started with STM32

When starting with ARM programming, I feel it's best to get the vendor's official
development board, rather than muck around with third-party breakout boards, for
these reasons:

- They are usually very economical.
- You get a well documented, working reference design.
- Comes with a hardware debugger.
- Easy to prototype with.

Since it's hard to argue about a $11 (inflated to Rs.1129 in our case) board, I
got the STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-F103RB board with the STM32F103RB chip.

In this article, I'll build a small project using this board. Our goals are:

1. Set up a development environment.
2. Learn how to debug and upload code.
3. Make an LED blink.
4. Learn how to use the USART peripheral.

The first thing to do is to set up a development environment. As I mentioned, I
decided to go with GCC, but even with GCC there are several choices, including
paid options with support. I chose the ARM GCC toolchain, Eclipse IDE, and OpenOCD
for debugging. I found that the simplest way of using these tools was via the
[Eclipse extensions for ARM GCC][1] developed by Liviu Ionescu.

For installation please follow the excellent documentation by Liviu below:

[http://gnuarmeclipse.github.io/install/][2]

Make sure you follow the steps in the given order. To quote the author:

*"Note for beginners: If performed for the first time, it is recommended to follow the steps by the book and avoid poetic licenses, since they might lead to tricky situations and subtle functional problems."*

Once you have gone through the installation, start an new project in Eclipse
by choosing *File->New->C Project* where you get this dialog:

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-init1.png)

Choose the appropriate chip, and then you get this dialog:

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-init2.png)

In *content* you can just choose empty. At the end the dialog, you will end up
with a directory structure similar to the one below:

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above tree, I removed the *_write.c* file supplied by the project, and I
also have *Debug/Release* populated above because I have built the executable.

The *stm32f1-stdperiph* directory above is the *Standard Peripheral Library* which
is a layer of code provided by STMicroelectronics which lets you use the chip
peripherals like GPIOs, ADSs, USARTs, etc. without directly setting up the registers.
(More on this later.)

One thing to note is that a lot of the unused code is filtered out in the project
settings, which can be found here:

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-src-filter.png)

Once you start using any of these files (eg. *stm32f10x_usart.c*) you need
remove that from the exclude filter above.

Next, you need to set up OpenOCD for debugging. This is already covered in the
installation list. But one thing I found to be missing is using OpenOCD to write the
code to the flash memory of the chip. You can easily set that up under  
*Run->External Tools->External Tools Configuration*:

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-ext-tools.png)

(To clarify, OpenOCD *debugging* only loads the code onto the RAM of the chip,
which is cleared when the chip is reset. The above writes to the Flash memory
of the chip, so it's retained on reset.)

Now it's almost time to start coding. But before that, you need to do a bit of reading,
and here's your list:

1. STM32F103x datasheet from STMicroelectronics
2. STM32F103x reference manual from STMicroelectronics
3. UM1724 User manual for STM32 Nucleo-64 boards from STMicroelectronics
4. AN2586 Application note - Getting started with STM32F10xxx hardware development

(1) above gives an overview of the chip whereas (2) goes into details - setting up
registers and programming the chip. (3) is a handy reference for the Nucleo board,
and (4) is helpful when you are designing your own PCB with the chip.

The above documents are all pretty cryptic, but fortunately there exists a great,
free, comprehensible reference to get started on STM32:

*Discovering the STM32 Microcontroller* by Prof. Geoffrey Brown

You can find the PDF link at the bottom of his list of publications.

[http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/geobrown/index.cgi/Publications][3]

I highly recommend that you get the above PDF and spend some time reading it before
you do any programming.

Before getting into what our program does, let's briefly look at a few
approaches (not comprehensive) to programming STM32:

1. Use Registers + C code
2. Use the Standard Peripheral Library
3. Use CMSIS
4. Use STM32Cube + HAL
5. Use some of the above and write your own portable "middleware"

You can read up on CMSIS and STM32Cube, and maybe read this [long discussion on eevblog][4],
but making any decision there is beyond the scope of this article. So let's talk a bit about simpler approaches (1) and (2) below.

Here's some code that sets up pin *PA5* as output so we can blink the LED (USR LD2)
on the Nucleo board.

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// enable clock for GPIOA and GPIOC
RCC->APB2ENR |= (RCC_APB2ENR_IOPAEN | RCC_APB2ENR_IOPCEN);

// set up PA5 as output
//
// clear bits Mode5[1:0] and CNF5[1:0]
uint32_t bitmask = GPIO_CRL_MODE5 | GPIO_CRL_CNF5;
uint32_t tmpReg = GPIOA->CRL;
tmpReg &= ~bitmask;
// set CNF5[1:0] and Mode5[1:0]
// CNF5[1:0]  -> 00: General purpose output push-pull
// MODE5[1:0] -> 10: Output mode, max speed 2 MHz.
tmpReg |= (GPIO_CRL_MODE5_1);
// set values to GPIOA_CRL
GPIOA->CRL = tmpReg;
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Above, we first enable the *peripheral clock* for GPIOA, and then proceed to
set the appropriate registers (see datasheet) to set *PA5* as an output.

It could be argued that the above code isn't "bare metal" enough. Definitions
like *RCC->APB2ENR* come from the *stm32f10x.h* file. You could certainly skip
these headers and code directly with register addresses given in the datasheet -
if you are feeling particularly masochistic.

Now let's code the same using the *Standard Peripheral Library*:  

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// enable clock for peripheral
RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOA, ENABLE);

// initialize GPIO structure
GPIO_InitTypeDef gpioInitStruct;
GPIO_StructInit(&gpioInitStruct);
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_5;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_Out_PP;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Speed = GPIO_Speed_2MHz;
GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &gpioInitStruct);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the code is much more readable that the first version. Another
fact is that this code is very easy to port across other chips from STMicroelectronics.
But the downside is that the code, being generic, covers a lot of stuff that may
not apply to your specific use. Take a look at *GPIO_Init* implementation in
*stm32f10x_gpio.c* and compare it with the "bare metal" code above.

One approach I can suggest is to use the *Standard Peripheral Library*, but not blindly.
Read through the implementation of the functions you are using. When the need arises, write your own
optimized functions that use just what you need.

Now let's get on with our program. We start with some initializations:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// LED is on PA5
// enable clock for peripheral GPIOA and GPIOC
RCC_APB2PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOA | RCC_APB2Periph_GPIOC, ENABLE);

// initialize GPIO structure
GPIO_InitTypeDef gpioInitStruct;
GPIO_StructInit(&gpioInitStruct);
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_5;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_Out_PP;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Speed = GPIO_Speed_2MHz;
GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &gpioInitStruct);

// set PC13 (User button 1) as input
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_13;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_IN_FLOATING;
GPIO_Init(GPIOC, &gpioInitStruct);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, we set up *PA5* (LED on Nucleo board) as output, and
*PC13* (Blue button on Nucleo board) as input. As before, peripheral clocks
are enabled for these ports.

Next, we set up serial communications on *USART2*.

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// serial comms
// use PA2 (TX) and PA3 (RX)
// USART2
// These are connected to the ST-Link circuit on the Nucleo board
// so the serial output will be via USB, on your computer

// enable clock for USART2
RCC_APB1PeriphClockCmd(RCC_APB1Periph_USART2, ENABLE);

// setup Tx/RX pins:

// init TX
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_2;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_AF_PP;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Speed = GPIO_Speed_50MHz;
GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &gpioInitStruct);
// init RX
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Pin = GPIO_Pin_3;
gpioInitStruct.GPIO_Mode = GPIO_Mode_IN_FLOATING;
GPIO_Init(GPIOA, &gpioInitStruct);

// setup USART2:

// initialize struct
USART_InitTypeDef usartInitStruct;
USART_StructInit(&usartInitStruct);
// set parameters
usartInitStruct.USART_BaudRate = 9600;
usartInitStruct.USART_Mode = USART_Mode_Rx | USART_Mode_Tx;
USART_Init(USART2, &usartInitStruct);
USART_Cmd(USART2, ENABLE);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We're going to use *PA2* (TX) and *PA3* (RX) for serial communications. This is because
they are already connected to the ST-Link hardware which is connected via USB to
your computer. (You could use *PA9* and *PA10* instead, but then you'll need to hook
up a separate USB to serial adapter on those lines for testing.) Once you start using
*Standard Peripheral Library*, the initialization scheme is quite uniform, so the
code above is pretty much self-explanatory.

Now let's look at the main loop:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// Infinite loop
volatile uint8_t val = 0;
uart_putc(USART2, '.');
uart_putc(USART2, '\n');
while (1)
{
  // read PC13 input
  uint8_t input = GPIO_ReadInputDataBit(GPIOC, GPIO_Pin_13);
  if (!input) {
    trace_printf("button pressed!\n");
    val = 1;
  }

  // if flag set go into serial input mode
  if (val) {
    // show prompt
    uart_putc(USART2, '>');
    // get input
    char c = uart_getc(USART2);
    uart_putc(USART2, '\n');
    uart_putc(USART2, '.');
    uart_putc(USART2, '\n');
    // set LED
    int led = (c == '0') ? 0 : 1;
    GPIO_WriteBit(GPIOA, GPIO_Pin_5, led);
    // reset input mode flag
    val = 0;
  }

  // wait
  myDelay(500);
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The main loop proceeds as follows: We first read the button input on *PC13*. If
the button is pressed, we set a flag *val*. If the flag is set, we enter an
"input mode" using the blocking call *uart_getc(USART2);*. We then read user
input (expecting '1'/'0') and use that to toggle the LED on *PA*. The UART methods
used are all defined in *stm32f10x_usart.c*, and the GPIO methods in *stm32f10x_gpio.c* -
all part of *Standard Peripheral Library*.

We'll talk a bit about the *myDelay()* function. This is implemented by
hooking into the *SysTick_Handler* of the chip:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
static volatile uint32_t sysTickCount = 0;

void myDelay(uint32_t nTime)
{
	sysTickCount = nTime;
	while(sysTickCount != 0);
}

void SysTick_Handler()
{
	if (sysTickCount != 0) {
		sysTickCount--;
	}
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Our *SysTick_Handler* overrides the default implementation in *exception_handlers.c*,
and we use this to implement a delay function, as shown above. (This implementation
  is from [Brown's book][3].)

To test the code, upload it the chip, open any serial communications application
on your computer (I use *CoolTerm*.), and connect at 9600 baud and default settings.

The code above is far from robust. If you are using serial communications, you
should probably use interrupts, for instance. But that's for another time.

## External Programming with NUCLEO-F103RB

As I mentioned, one advantage of getting the official development board
is the build-in hardware debugger. This hardware in most cases can be used to
program external devices. In the case of the NUCLEO-F103RB, there is an SWD
interface which can be used for this purpose.

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-nucleo-ext.png)

The above figure is from the Nucleo user manual, and it shows how you can
remove CN2 jumpers (move them to grounded CN11, CN12 so you don't lose them)
and use the CN4 SWD connector for programming an external target.

I bought a cheap (Rs. 280, $4) STM32F103C8T6 board from ebay to test this out.

![STM32](/images/2016/10/stm32-nucleo-bo.jpg)

It worked great! Pins 1 to 5 on *CN4* on the Nucleo
board were needed. There's nothing special to be done - once connected, debug and program will
automatically go to the external target. I wrote a simple blinky program for testing,
and for this board, the LED was on *PC13*.

## Conclusion

Starting with ARM can be intimidating, especially if you come from the 8-bit
AVR world. But there are good learning resources and free Open Source tools
available that can help you with this task. Just be ready to do some heavy
reading. :-)
