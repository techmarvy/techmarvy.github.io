The 8 pin male dual row headers on some of the small peripheral
boards (for example NRF24L01 and ESP8266 boards) are not suited for a
breadboard - unless you are trying to short the pins out. A simple
hack is to cut female pin headers, stick them together with hot glue,
and bend the pins with needle-nose pliers. The photo above is
self-explanatory, I think. A simple hack, but it works.
