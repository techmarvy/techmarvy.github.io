## Introduction

In this project, we will talk to the popular ultrasonic distance
sensor HC-SR04 using the Nordic nRF51-DK board, and transmit the
distance information over BLE using the NUS (Nordic UART Service). We
will be utilizing *GPIO* and *Timer1* for this purpose.

## Prerequisite

Before you read further, please take a look at my [previous article on
nRF51-DK programming using GCC][1], since we're going to use the same
development setup here.

## Communicating with HC-SR04

I have written about this sensor before, interfacing it with [Arduino][4] as well as [ATtiny84][5]. Here's how the HC-SR04 works:

* Send a 10us HIGH pulse on the Trigger pin.
* The sensor sends out a “sonic burst” of 8 cycles.
* Listen to the Echo pin, and the duration of the next HIGH signal will
  give you the time taken by the sound to go back and forth from sensor
  to target.

So we need (a) a way to send the trigger pulse and (b) a method to
measure the echo pulse.

## Connections

Here is how the nRF51-DK is hooked up to the HC-SR04:

| HC-SR04 | nRF51-DK |
|:------- |:--------|
| VCC | 5V |
| GND | GND |
| Trig | P0.01 |
| Echo | P0.02 via R DIV |

The HC-SR04 runs on 5V, but our nRF51422 runs on 3.3V logic. It's OK
to send data to the HC-SR04 on 3.3 V TTL, but it's **not OK** to
receive a 5V pulse from the sensor. Hence, we route the *Echo* through
a resistor divider as shown below.

Now let's look at how to send and receive data.

## Trigger Pulse

You can send the trigger pulse using the GPIO feature of the nRF51. The code looks like this:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// send 12us trigger pulse
//    _
// __| |__
nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinTrig);
nrf_delay_us(20);
nrf_gpio_pin_set(pinTrig);
nrf_delay_us(12);
nrf_gpio_pin_clear(pinTrig);
nrf_delay_us(20);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

What you are doing above is toggling a GPIO pin HIGH and LOW, creating
a pulse, and sure enough, you get a response from the *Echo* pin of the
HC-SR04.

## Echo Pulse

The distance is encoded in the width of the HIGH pulse returned by the
HC-SR04. To measure this width, we will make use of the nRF51 *Timer1*
peripheral on the nRF51822. The *Timer1* is a 8/16 bit timer which
runs at 16 MHz.

In their SDK, Nordic provides higher level APIs (which start with
*nrf_drv_timer*) to set up these timers. But I found their
documentation and API to be confusing, so I decided to use the
registers directly. I think this is a better approach in any case, as
it corresponds directly to what you read in the nRF51 reference
manual. Here is the code that sets up the timer and the interrupt
routine:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// set up and start Timer1
void start_timer(void)
{   
  NRF_TIMER1->MODE = TIMER_MODE_MODE_Timer;  
  NRF_TIMER1->TASKS_CLEAR = 1;
  // set prescalar n
  // f = 16 MHz / 2^(n)
  uint8_t prescaler = 0;
	NRF_TIMER1->PRESCALER = prescaler;
	NRF_TIMER1->BITMODE = TIMER_BITMODE_BITMODE_16Bit;

  // 16 MHz clock generates timer tick every 1/(16000000) s = 62.5 nano s
  // With compare enabled, the interrupt is fired every: 62.5 * comp1 nano s
  // = 0.0625*comp1 micro seconds
  // multiply this by 2^(prescalar)

  uint16_t comp1 = 500;
  // set compare
	NRF_TIMER1->CC[1] = comp1;

  // set conversion factor
  countToUs = 0.0625*comp1*(1 << prescaler);

  printf("timer tick = %f us\n", countToUs);

  // enable compare 1
	NRF_TIMER1->INTENSET =
    (TIMER_INTENSET_COMPARE1_Enabled << TIMER_INTENSET_COMPARE1_Pos);

  // use the shorts register to clear compare 1
  NRF_TIMER1->SHORTS = (TIMER_SHORTS_COMPARE1_CLEAR_Enabled <<
                        TIMER_SHORTS_COMPARE1_CLEAR_Pos);

  // enable IRQ
  NVIC_EnableIRQ(TIMER1_IRQn);

  // start timer
  NRF_TIMER1->TASKS_START = 1;
}

// Timer 1 IRQ handler
// just increment count
void TIMER1_IRQHandler(void)
{
	if (NRF_TIMER1->EVENTS_COMPARE[1] &&
      NRF_TIMER1->INTENSET & TIMER_INTENSET_COMPARE1_Msk) {

    // clear compare register event
    NRF_TIMER1->EVENTS_COMPARE[1] = 0;

    tCount++;
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the *start_timer()* method above, we start by setting the
*prescaler* of the timer to 0. The timer frequency is given by
$$f_{TIMER} = \frac{16 MHz}{2^{PRESCALER}}$$. The 16 MHz clock
generates timer tick every 1/(16000000) s = 62.5 nano seconds. We then
set the *compare1* register to a value of 500. This means that the
timer generates an interrup every $$62.5*500$$ nano seconds or 31.25
microseconds. We set up the flags for *compare1*, enable the
interrupt, and set the *SHORTS* register to clear the task when the
interrupt fires. (This is like a shortcut so that you don't need to
manually do this in the interrupt routine.)

In the interrupt routine, we increment a global counter *tCount* and
clear the *compare1* event. If you don't do the latter, you will not
get an interrupt the next time around. It's best to have minimal
amount of code *TIMER1_IRQHandler()* as otherwise, it will introduce
latency into the timer, and that will mess up the accurancy of your
timing.

## Computing the Distance

Now that we are counting every 31.25 microseconds, let's see how we
put that use to compute the distance. Here is the relevant portion
from the distance computation method:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
  // listen for echo and time it
  //       ____________
  // _____|            |___

  // wait till Echo pin goes high
  while(!nrf_gpio_pin_read(pinEcho));
  // reset counter
  tCount = 0;
  // wait till Echo pin goes low
  while(nrf_gpio_pin_read(pinEcho));

  // calculate duration in us
  float duration = countToUs*tCount;

  // dist = duration * speed of sound * 1/2
  // dist in cm = duration in us * 10^-6 * 340.29 * 100 * 1/2
  float distance = duration*0.017;
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

As soon as we send the trigger pulse, we loop around *pinEcho* till it
goes high. Then we reset *tCount* so that the timer can start counting
it, and loop around till *pinEcho* goes low. At this point *tCount*
will be proportional to the pulse width, and we convert it to
microseconds using the factor computed earlier. The distance can then
be computed using the good old physics equation $$x = vt$$. The factor $$1/2$$
above comes in because the sound is travelling back and forth to the sensor
- so you just need to consider half the time measured by the sensor.

## The BLE Part

This project uses the S110 softdevice. Once we have the distance
information, we send it over BLE via the Nordic UART Service
(NUS). You can view it on your BLE device (phone/tablet) using the
[Nordic nRFtoolbox app][6].
