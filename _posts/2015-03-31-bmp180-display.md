I was in Bhutan last December, and as we travelled to different
locations, I kept wondering what the temperature and altitude was, and
wished I had some gizmo that would show me these values. Back home, I
did a bit of research on altitude sensors, and one that came up was
the cheap BMP180 sensor. It measures temperature and
pressure, and the latter can be used to calculate the altitude. It's
been lying around with me the past few months, and now I've finally
gotten around to building a display around it.

This project uses an Arduino Pro Mini 3.3 V clone, a BMP180 sensor and a
Nokia 5110 LCD module to display the current temperature, altitude and
pressure. Here is the schematic for the project:

<br />

The circuit uses a push button so that the circuit and display is on
only as long as you keep it pressed, conserving the battery. To
interface the Arduino with the BMP180, I used [Sparkfun's
library][2]. For the Nokia 5110 LCD, I used the [Adafruit Nokia 5110
library][3]. The code alternates between drawing a silly
"mountain/location" animation and reporting the sensor values. I also
built a laser cut enclosure for the project, using using the [Inkscape
T-Slot Boxmaker plugin][4].

You can find all files realted to this project including code,
schematic and enclosure design at [my github link here][1].

The end product turned out to be a bit bulkier than I wanted. With a
custom PCB and a LiPo battery, I could have made something much
smaller. I also want to find a better alternative to the laser-cut
T-slot method - maybe combine laser cutting with 3D printing. Oh well,
next time.
