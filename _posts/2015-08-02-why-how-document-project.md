*I write this from the perspective of a maker. When I say project, I mean hardware project, and when I say writing I mean non-fiction writing.*
<hr />

## Motivation

I have learned much from the work of others. And much of that learning
came about because those people put in the effort to document their work on the
internet. Unfortunately, a large fraction of makers do not take the
time to write up their projects. This is a big loss for not only the
makers themselves, but also the community at large that could have
benefited from their work. In this article, I attempt to make the case
for documentation by discussing how it could be benefitial, and also
look at some of the common obstacles towards achieving that goal. I
also offer some practical suggestions on how you can get started with
the process.

## Why Document your Projects?

Here are the primary reasons I think you should document your projects:

1. It helps others.
2. It deepens your understanding.
3. It opens doors.
4. It is your best reference.

Let's take a brief look at the above points.

### It Helps Others

The most obvious reason to document your work is so that it benefits
others. Since the maker community is fuelled by the spirit of sharing,
it makes sense that you publish your work.

### It Deepens your Understanding

If you are like me, then your mind is a cacophony of activity, with
thoughts flitting about from one topic to the next. When you try to
put this fuzzy cloud down on paper, you will need to make a linear
narrative out of it -- if you want others to understanding what you're
saying.  Fact needs to follow fact in a logical order, and in this
process of converting your thoughts to a structured document, you will
find that your own understanding of your project has deepened.

### It Opens Doors

A long term practitioner of any art will tell you that it's not a
single work that matters, but the body of work you create over a
period of time. When you make documentation a habit, you will soon
find that you have created a portfolio of projects. This is much more
credible than a resume with exagerrated accounts of your fabulous
acheivements. In fact your documentation *is* your real resume. People will
eventually notice your work, and it will open doors. This blog for
example, has given me international exposure. It has put me touch with
the maker community at large, given me oppportinities for
collaboration, and played a part in landing my first book contract.

### It is Your Best Reference

When you write up a project, it is a note for your future self.
Nothing reads better than your own notes on a topic. That is also a
good reason to write *clear* documentation, so you don't end up
cursing yourself in the future. I can't tell you the number of times I
visit my own blog to dig up some obscure project detail I worked
on months ago.

## Obstacles & Solutions

Here are some of the common obstacles that get in the way of writing
up a project:

1. Writing is Hard
2. Procrastination
3. Fear of Criticism
4. Lack of Platform Expertise

Let's look at the above problems and potential solutions.

### Writing is Hard

Here is my favorite quote on writing, from American journalist Gene Fowler:

*"Writing is easy: All you do is sit staring at a blank sheet of paper until drops of blood form on your forehead."*

Writing is hard, but that's not reason enough to deter you from this
craft. Writing is a skill that can be learned - just like driving a
car, or operating a crane. You don't need to be "born with it" -
unless you are aspiring to be the next Shakespeare. But you do need to
practise your craft regularly. Don't expect to get better at writing
by whining about how hard it is.

### Procrastination

I hear this a lot: "I'll write up my project after I am done." No, you
won't. The only way to document a project is to do it along with the
project. But how will you get any work done then? The trick it to keep
it simple and fast - just use a *.txt* file and make notes as you
work. I don't shoot photos and videos of project after I am done - I
do it continously, knowing that I will use only what works. (It's also
great to have a visual record of your failures and successes.) If you
practise this, you will find that when you are done with your project,
magically, a skeletal documentation already exists. Now all you need to
do it flesh it out and make it presentable.

### Fear of Criticism

When you make your work public, you are naturally opening yourself up
for criticism. Unfortunately, the anonymity of the web makes people
harsher than in real life when it comes to interacting with others.
But getting criticised by a knowledgeable person has its
benefits - you just need to let your ego down, and listen to what is
being said, and how you can use that information to improve your
project. Another fact from my experience - the people who express
gratitute for your work will far outnumber the detractors. Also think
about this - not only did you make something, but you took the time to
document it, making it useful for a lot of people. I think you've done
far better than most of your critics.

### Lack of Platform Expertise

Oh, but I don't have the time/patience/expertise to create a blog or
website, you say. Unfortunately, the year is 2015 and your argument
holds no water. Due to the easy availability of blogging platforms,
you could get going in less than 10 minutes. I will address this issue
in more detail in the next section.

## How to Document your Project

Hopefully I have now convinced you -- or at least made a few chinks on
that anti-documentation armour of yours -- that you need to write up your
projects. Now let me offer some suggestions on how to get started.

1. Start a blog today.
2. Your blog is your journal.
3. Structure your Documentation.
4. Read up on writing.

Let me elucidate a bit on the above.

## Start a Blog Today

This is the easiest way to start documenting your project, and signing
up with *WordPress*, *Tumblr* or similar platforms takes only
minutes. Another option is to sign up with maker-centric blogging
platform like *hackaday.io* where you can share your projects and hang
out with other makers. You can get more elaborate later - buy a domain
name, set up your own website, find the perfect theme for your
website, etc. But first things first -- starting putting up words on
the screen.

## The Blog is your Journal

Don't think that you need to complete an elaborate project in order to
write something about it. Think of the blog as your project
journal. As you make progress with your project, keep updating your
blog. You will find that this workflow will actually help you
execute your project better. Any non-trivial hardware project has a
number of sub-tasks, and if you consider each of these tasks as a
blog article, it immediately gives you a set of targets to work
on. With each update, you are one step closer to your project goal,
boosted with the satisfaction that comes from documenting and sharing
your progress.

## Structure your Documentation

"Pick a style and stick to it" - this advice works across many
domains, including when it comes to structuring your project
documentation. Sticking to a consistent presentation of titles,
sections, headings, figures, images, captions, references, etc. will
not only make your job easier, but will give a more uniform and
professional appearance to your website. Your personal style is not
something you start with, but something that you discover and refine
over a period of time.

## Read up on Writing

Writing is a craft, and it can learned, like any other craft. And like
any craft, practice makes perfect. The two books on writing that
helped me the most are:

1. **On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction** by *William Zinsser*.
2. **The Elements of Style** by *William Strunk Jr. & E. B. White*.

# Conclusion

Making is fun, but documenting and sharing your project elevates it
to the next level. Hopefully I have convinced you that taking
this next step is not that hard. Good writing is good writing, no
matter what the medium. You don't need endorsement from a publishing
house to put out good content. So go ahead and write up that project,
and publish it on the web.  You will be doing yourself a favour.
