## Introduction

In this project, we will control two motors over BLE using the
Nordic nRF51-DK. To do this, we will use a motor driver based on the
Toshiba TB6612FNG chip. We will use GPIOs and PWM to communicate
with this board.

## Background

Before you read further, you might want to look at some of my previous
articles on nRF51822 programming, since we're going to use the same
development setup here.

## Communicating with TB6612FNG

For this project, I used a [Pololu TB6612FNG][6] board. A similar board
is available from [Sparkfun][7] also. You can see the connections for the
Pololu board below:

![pololu-TB6612FNG](/images/2015/08/pololu-TB6612FNG.png "pololu-TB6612FNG")

The pins *PWMA* and *PWMB* control the speeds of the two DC motors. (The
speed being proportional to the duty cycle of the PWM signal.) The pins
*(AIN1, AIN2)* and *(BIN1, BIN2)* control the direction of rotation
of the motors. The *STBY* "standby" pin has to be high for any of the
controls to work. The *VCC* pin is the supply for the board logic, and
has to be in the range of 2.7 to 5.5 V. The *VMOT* pin is the motor
power supply, which has to be in the range of 4.5 to 13.5 V. *(AO1, AO2)*
and *(BO1, BO2)* are output supplies to the two motors.

The speed and direction of the motors can be controlled in various ways,
as shown in an excerpt from the Toshiba TB6612FNG data sheet below:

## Connections

Here is how the nRF51-DK is hooked up to the TB6612FNG in this project:

| nRF51-DK | TB6612FNG|
|:------- |:--------|
| P0.01| PWMA |
| P0.02| AIN1 |
| P0.03| AIN2 |
| P0.04| PWMB |
| P0.05| BIN1 |
| P0.06| BIN2 |
| P0.07| STBY |
| GND | GND |

In my case, the motors are rated at around 4.5 V. I supply *VMOT* via
a 11.2 V LiPO battery regulated down to 5V using a 7805 regulator IC.  

## Motor Control

The PWM module is initialized in the code as follows:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
   // Create the instance "PWM1" using TIMER1.
   APP_PWM_INSTANCE(PWM1,1);   
   //...

   // 2-channel PWM
   app_pwm_config_t pwm1_cfg =
      APP_PWM_DEFAULT_CONFIG_2CH(1000L, PWMA, PWMB);

    pwm1_cfg.pin_polarity[0] = APP_PWM_POLARITY_ACTIVE_HIGH;
    pwm1_cfg.pin_polarity[1] = APP_PWM_POLARITY_ACTIVE_HIGH;

    /* Initialize and enable PWM. */
    err_code = app_pwm_init(&PWM1,&pwm1_cfg,pwm_ready_callback);
    APP_ERROR_CHECK(err_code);
    app_pwm_enable(&PWM1);
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the code above, we set up *PWM1* instance with a frequency of
1000 Hz on the *PWMA* and *PWMB* pins.

To control the motors, we use the Nordic [nRFToolboxApp][9].
The app has a configurable keypad which send strings to the
nRF51-DK over the Nordic UART Service when the buttons are pressed. We
check for these strings and take appropriate action in the code as
follows:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
// Function for handling the data from the Nordic UART Service.
static void nus_data_handler(ble_nus_t * p_nus, uint8_t * p_data,
                             uint16_t length)
{
  if (strstr((char*)(p_data), RECORD)) {
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), SHUFFLE)) {
    forward = !forward;
    set_dir(forward);
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), STOP)) {
    stop_motors();
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), PLAY)) {
    start_motors();
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), FORWARD)) {
    turn_right = true;
  }
  else if (strstr((char*)(p_data), REWIND)) {
    turn_left = true;
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here is how you start and stop the motors, and set the speed of rotation:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
/* stop_motors: bring motors to a stop */
void stop_motors()
{
  nrf_gpio_pin_clear(STBY);
}

/* start_motors: start motors */
void start_motors()
{
  nrf_gpio_pin_set(STBY);
}

/* set_speed: set speed for both motors */
void set_speed(uint8_t speed)
{
  curr_speed = speed;
  // set speed
  while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 0, speed) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
  while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 1, speed) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);      
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see above, setting *STBY* to *LOW* will stop the
motors. Setting the duty cycle will effect the speed of the motors
proportionately. Here's how you set the direction of rotation of the
motors:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
/* direction: change motor direction */
void set_dir(bool forward)
{
  if(forward) {
    // set direction A
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(AIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(AIN2);
    // set direction B
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(BIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(BIN2);
  }
  else {
     // set direction A
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(AIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(AIN2);
    // set direction B
    nrf_gpio_pin_clear(BIN1);
    nrf_gpio_pin_set(BIN2);
  }
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Flipping the input pin states switches the direction of motors above.

In my case, the motors are fitted to a 2WD robot chassis with a caster
wheel. So to make the wheels turn, I can just reduce the speed of one
of the wheels, as follows:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
/* turn: turn left/right */
void turn(bool left)
{
  // store current speed
  uint8_t tmp = curr_speed;

  if (left) {
    while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 0, 10) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
    while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 1, 25) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
  }
  else {
    while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 0, 25) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
    while (app_pwm_channel_duty_set(&PWM1, 1, 10) == NRF_ERROR_BUSY);
  }

  // turn for x secs
  nrf_delay_ms(1000);

  // restore speed
  set_speed(tmp);
}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above code, I reduce the speed, make the turn by just rotating
one of the wheels, wait for a bit, and then restore speed. This has
the action of changing the direction of movement towards left or
right.

Calling *turn()* above directly from the NUS data handler messes up
the PWM signal. (The Nordic implentation of nRF51 PWM has [several known
bugs][10].) So I side-stepped this problem by just setting a flag and
executing the turn in the main loop:

{% highlight C %}
{% raw %}
    // loop
    while(1) {

      if(turn_left) {
        turn(true);
        turn_left = false;
      }
      else if(turn_right) {
        turn(false);
        turn_right = false;
      }

      //
      nrf_delay_ms(50);
    }
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can refer to the source code link below to see how all these
pieces fit together.
